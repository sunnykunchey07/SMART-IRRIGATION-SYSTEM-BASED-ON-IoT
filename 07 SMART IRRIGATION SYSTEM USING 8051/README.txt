8051 Microcontroller is a cost effective system
which can be easily coded in embedded C. Microcontroller
is a 8-bit processor which contains 40 pin DIP (Dual Inline
Package)1
. This project uses fully automated system which
has been coded to work in accordance with temperature.
Some plants need specific temperature and environment
condition to get maximum yield from it. So farmers prefer
growing some plants in temperature controlled area like
green houses. This prototype will automatically cools the
temperature by running the exhaust fan and also water
cooling method. This method can help the farmers who
stay away from the field. It reduces lot of labor work and
time. It also reduces over irrigation and saves water.
Agriculture system needs accurate monitoring system. The
temperature sensors continuously sense the temperature of
environment when temperature is higher than the required
temperature. It drives the exhaust fan. If temperature is still
higher it drives the suction pump and cools the
temperature. When temperature is cooled it automatically
stops the exhaust fan and pump.
